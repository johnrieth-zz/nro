The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is a member of the 16-agency Intelligence Community (IC) and the Department of Defense (DoD). Our mission is to design, acquire, launch, and operate "Innovative Overhead Intelligence Systems for National Security." NRO's diverse workforce includes personnel from the DoD, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the National Security Agency. Air Force and CIA employees comprise a majority of the agency's population as the NRO's advanced satellite systems require a talented cadre of scientists, engineers, communications systems specialists, and program and acquisition managers.

In 2015, the NRO established its own civilian workforce - the NRO DoD Cadre. This Congressionally-approved workforce stability initiative allowed NRO to create a stable, indigenous workforce by converting Air Force and Navy DoD civilians to NRO DoD civilians. This effort helps to ensure NRO has the "right people in the right places at the right time" and provides Cadre personnel with their own career paths, advanced degree and professional development programs. DoD Cadre vacancies are posted on the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) USAJobs: www.usajobs.com

Together, the NRO workforce is meeting today's complex intelligence threats head-on and is poised to counter future challenges in order to uphold our vision of "vigilance from above".
