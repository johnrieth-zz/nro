## Welcome!

This repository contains an idea of a redesigned website for the National Reconnaissance Office. [Current NRO website](http://nro.gov/).

This README is [adapted from 18F](https://github.com/18F/afrs-pa/blob/master/README.md)

### NRO

The mission of the National Reconnaissance Office is to provides satellite intelligence the Armed Services, the Intelligence Community, and other partners.

## Users and stakeholders

Potential users are companies interested in doing business with the NRO, policymakers, the American people.

Stakeholders are likely to be the NRO, NRO federal & military partners, and contractors.

## Product vision

- Presents users with a multi-device website that has a functional, modern interface
- Secure site that complies with the [HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/)
- Uses U.S. Web Design System to build upon proven code.
- Reduce the number of navigation items

## Questions

- What is the NRO trying to communicate with its web presence?
- Does the [Acquisition Center of Excellence](https://acq.westfields.net/) need to be updated to be multi-device friendly.
    - What percentage of users access the site from mobile?
